***HTML - Lists***

HTML offers web authors three ways for specifying lists of information. All lists must contain one or more list elements.

ul : An unordered list. This will list items using plain bullets.

ol : An ordered list. This will use different schemes of numbers to list your items.
 
dl : A definition list. This arranges your items in the same way as they are arranged in a dictionary. 
  

***HTML Ordered Lists***

*If you are required to put your items in a numbered list instead of bulleted, 
then HTML ordered list will be used. This list is created by using <ol> tag. 
The numbering starts at one and is incremented by one for each successive ordered list element tagged with li.*
  
  
***HTML Definition Lists***
  
*HTML and XHTML supports a list style which is called definition lists where entries are listed like in a dictionary or encyclopedia
The definition list is the ideal way to present a glossary, list of terms, or other name/value list.*

Definition List makes use of following three tags.

dl Defines the start of the list
  
dt A term
  
dd Term definition*
  
***Box dimensions***
  
Each box has a content area (e.g., text, an image, etc.) and optional surrounding padding, border,
  
and margin areas; the size of each area is specified by properties defined below.
  
The following diagram shows how these areas relate and the terminology used to refer to pieces of margin, border, and padding.
