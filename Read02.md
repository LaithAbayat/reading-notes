What is Git?

Git and GitHub are not the same thing! So, what are the differences?

Git is a version control system. It provides two key services to users:

It allows multiple users to work on the same repository at the same time without concern about interfering with each others work.
It allows users to view and return to previous versions of the repository.

A repository a collection of files and folders that represents one specific project or application. , we do have some repositories that serve other purposes (and don't always contain code). 
For example, we have several repositories that are used for documentation.
