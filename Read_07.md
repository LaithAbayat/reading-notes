***Object Oriented programming (OOP)***

Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. 

It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), 

which are used to create individual instances of objects. There are many object-oriented programming languages including JavaScript, C++, Java, and Python.

A class is an abstract blueprint used to create more specific, concrete objects. 

Classes often represent broad categories, like Car or Dog that share attributes. 

These classes define what attributes an instance of this type will have, like color, but not the value of those attributes for a specific object.

Classes can also contain functions, called methods available only to objects of that type. 

These functions are defined within the class and perform some action helpful to that specific type of object.

***Benefits of OOP***

-OOP models complex things as reproducible, simple structures

-Reusable, OOP objects can be used across programs

-Allows for class-specific behavior through polymorphism

-Easier to debug, classes often contain all applicable information to them

*Secure, protects information through encapsulation

***HTML Tables***

A table is a structured set of data made up of rows and columns (tabular data).

A table allows you to quickly and easily look up values that indicate some kind of connection between different types of data, 

for example a person and their age, or a day of the week, or the timetable for a local swimming pool.

***When should you NOT use HTML tables?***

HTML tables should be used for tabular data â€” this is what they are designed for. 

Unfortunately, a lot of people used to use HTML tables to lay out web pages, e.g. one row to contain the header,

one row to contain the content columns, one row to contain the footer, etc. You can find more details and an example at Page Layouts in our Accessibility Learning Module. 

This was commonly used because CSS support across browsers used to be terrible; table layouts are much less common nowadays, but you might still see them in some corners of the web.
