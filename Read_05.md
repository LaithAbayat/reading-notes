***HTML Images***

The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

The <img> tag has two required attributes:

src - Specifies the path to the image
alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image
Syntax.

***CSS Text Color***

The color property is used to set the color of the text. The color is specified by:

a color name - like "red"

a HEX value - like "#ff0000"

an RGB value - like "rgb(255,0,0)"

Look at CSS Color Values for a complete list of possible color values.

The default text color for a page is defined in the body selector.

Color keyword: 
In an HTML file, enter p { color: black;} to change the color for every paragraph, where black refers to your chosen color.

Hexadecimal: In an HTML file, enter p { color: #000000;} to change the color, where 000000 refers to your chosen hex value.

RGBA: In an HTML file, enter p { color: rgba(47,86,135,1);} to change the color, where 47,86,135,1 refers to your chosen RGBA value.

CSS gives you control over the appearance of text on the web pages you build and manage. In this guide, we show you how to change font colors in CSS using color keywords, hexadecimal color codes, or RGB color numbers.


Color values can be expressed as color keywords, hexadecimal color numbers, or RGB color numbers. For this lesson, you will need to have an HTML document to see the CSS changes and a separate CSS file that's attached to that document.
