**What is HTML?**

*Hypertext markup language. It is the language that web browsers read to build a web page. It acts as a ‘blueprint’ to display data on a user’s screen. This is the basic building block of the web. Every page on the Internet is just HTML at its core.*

**What are HTML elements?**

*Elements are what we use to tell the browser how we want the data supplied to be displayed.*

**What is a ‘tag’?**

*An element consists of an opening and closing tag. The data supplied between the tags will be displayed per the instructions of the element.
How does the browser use HTML to create what I see?
The browser reads and interprets the HTML file to understand how the developer intended the data to appear on the screen.*

**What are the basic HTML elements?**

*The elements we learned about were html, head, body, ‘p’, span, div, and h1-h6*

**What is CSS?**

*As already mentioned, CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a different language than HTML. It allows us to add color and style to our web pages. Usually, when we think about web pages, we think about nicely put-together, pretty-looking sites, and so far what we have built has been pretty bland, if not ugly. Once the browser reads the HTML, it will then read the CSS and give different styling rules to different elements in our HTML based on how we select them.
The style and link Elements
Before we can add CSS to our web page, we need to inform the browser that what it is reading is in fact CSS. We can tell the browser that through HTML elements known as the style and link elements. These elements will go in between the head tags, as it is not necessarily data we need to appear on the screen.
There are two ways of including CSS in our HTML.*

**We can write our CSS directly between two style tags:**

**We can link to an external CSS file using the link element. This element will include two attributes: rel and href. rel will refer to the type of file we are linking: in this case, “stylesheet”, and the href will point to the location of the file.**

**Introduction to CSS Selectors**

*In order for us to apply styling rules to HTML elements, we have to know which elements to apply the rules to. This is where selectors come in. You can select all elements of a certain type: p, div, body, and etc. Or you can apply a class or id to each individual element. We apply these selectors to the HTML tags themselves in the form of an attribute*

**Styling Rules**

*Now that we have some HTML elements selected, we can begin to add styling. There are a LOT of different ways you can style an object. You can control how big or small it is, what color it is, where it is placed on the screen, or even if it is visible or not. We will go over some of the most common styling properties and how to use them.
background or background-color*
Background can be set to a variety of rules. Most common would be setting the background to a color or an image. Both are displayed below. If you want to be more explicit, you can use the property background-color to only set the color of the background.
